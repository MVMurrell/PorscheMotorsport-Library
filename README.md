This Project was written by Michael Murrell.


The assignment is as stated below:

The goal is to have you implement C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Destroy), which is some of the most common behavior on the web (Facebook is basically nothing but CRUD for instance). It represents the states of persistence that almost every application has (further reading for those interested). To simulate how you would read data from and write data to a database, we are just going to use an array or map for persistence.
Your application should adhere to the MVC pattern. Benefits of the MVC pattern are similar to that of encapsulation. There is a separation of concerns between the individual elements that make up the model, view, and controller respectively. Changing code in one has no affect on the code in the others.

In the future:
I would like to implement pictures to show be shown when a car is brought up.

When the initial page is displayed I would like to have the pictures sized uniformally so the page doesn’t have to resize when switching from picture to picture.

Additional work needs to be done on the input fields to handle things like commas in number fields.

I would like to add additional tables for columns such as the engine to bring up more information for those  entities.

How to use this application:
Run the application. At the home screen you have the option to create a car or find a car by ID.
To find a car by id, simply place the ID of the car you would like to search by and press go. The full details will be displayed along with the ability to update the car or delete it. If you choose to delete a car you will not be given a chance to verify your decision but you will be able to see the full details of the car you deleted. If you choose to update the car you will be given the 5 parameters that will are allowed to be modified. Once finished press submit and the updated car will be displayed.

Back at the home page, If you choose to create a car, the create page will be displayed with the ar characteristics shown as empty. It is important that you have all of the car’s information at this point as only a few characteristics are capable of being updated after the car is updated. Once finished, press submit and the new car will be displayed. If you would like to go home. Simply press “Home”.
